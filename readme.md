This small app is going to query to the Merriam Webster Dictionary API in order to provide a way to look up vocabulary and eventually persist it.

The goal here is to practice dealing with API response payload and dynamically created markup.

Idea here is to be able to save all these words that I've been accumulating throughout reading. Many apps exist to look up words, but I'd like to create one that saves the words I'm interested in remembering.
